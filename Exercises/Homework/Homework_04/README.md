# Homework 4

## Exercise 1

> We need a program for our club and you are tasked to create the data structures for it.
>
> Create a *Date struct* with *day*, *month* and *year*.
>
> Create also a *Person struct* that uses the *Date struct* and has the following properties: *name, birthdate, gender, occupation, registration_date* and if the *Person* is an *active_member* or not.
>
> Choose fitting data types for the fields and create a print function that prints all data in a format of your choosing.

The solution can be found [here](Exercise_1/).

**Output**

```
==============================
Name: John Jackson
Gender: Male
Occupation: Artist
Birthdate: 1.1.1987
Registration date: 11.12.2000
Active member: false
==============================

==============================
Name: Mickey Mouse
Gender: Male
Occupation: Detective
Birthdate: 3.4.1977
Registration date: 7.2.2011
Active member: true
==============================

==============================
Name: Emma Kidman
Gender: Female
Occupation: Singer
Birthdate: 1.1.1960
Registration date: 6.5.1978
Active member: true
==============================
```

## Exercise 2

> Create a function that has a *static counter* inside which counts how many times the function has been called, and prints the value of it.
>
> Example output =>  
> *The method `Person::debug()` has been called 1 time(s).*  
> *The method `Person::debug()` has been called 2 time(s).*  
> *The method `Person::debug()` has been called 3 time(s).*  
> *The method `Person::debug()` has been called 4 time(s).*
>
> Also add an *id* field for the *Person struct* (from the last assignment) that starts from *1* and increments by one for every new person created *2, 3, 4, 5...* and so forth. Use *static* to keep track of how many persons have been created to give everyone a unique *id*.

The solution can be found [here](Exercise_2/).

**Output**

```
Created a person with id: 1
Created a person with id: 2
Created a person with id: 3
The method `Person::debug()` has been called 1 time(s).
The method `Person::debug()` has been called 2 time(s).
The method `Person::debug()` has been called 3 time(s).
The method `Person::debug()` has been called 4 time(s).
Current `Person::id` value is: 3
