# Homework 4

## Exercise 1

> We need a program for our club and you are tasked to create the data structures for it.
>
> Create a *Date struct* with *day*, *month* and *year*.
>
> Create also a *Person struct* that uses the *Date struct* and has the following properties:
>
> *name, birthdate, gender, occupation, registration_date* and if the *Person* is an *active_member* or not.
>
> Choose fitting data types for the fields and create a print function that prints all data in a format of your choosing.

The solution can be found [here](Exercise_1/).
