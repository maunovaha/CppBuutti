# Exercise 3

> Make a *class* called *Issue* that has *name*, *description* and *priority_level* (enum). The priority level should have *high*, *medium* and *low* as enum values.
>
> Make a function for the *Issue class* that prints it.
>
> Example output =>  
> *Fire! - The building is on fire. - [HIGH PRIORITY]*  
> *Trash can - It smells and should be changed. - [Medium priority]*  
> *Buy new curtains - The old curtains are ugly. - [Low priority]*
