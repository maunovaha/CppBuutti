# Homework 5

## Exercise 1

> Create a program that produces *Caesar cipher* from your input. First input is the text (use *std::getline*) and the second input is the shift anount *n*. In *Caesar cipher* alphabet is moved for *n* letters forward.
>
> Example output =>  
> *Write a text:*  
> *aaabbb*  
> *How much do you want to shift?*  
> *1*  
> *The caesar chiper for "aaabbb" is "bbbccc".*
>
> *Write a text:*  
> *nakki*  
> *How much do you want to shift?*  
> *2*  
> *The caesar chiper for "nakki" is "pcmmk".*
>
> *Write a text:*  
> *avaruus*  
> *How much do you want to shift?*  
> *1*  
> *The caesar chiper for "avaruus" is "bwbsvvt".*

The solution can be found [here](Exercise_1/).

## Exercise 2

> Make a *username generator* that takes name and birth year as an input and creates a classic *name + birth year* username.
>
> Example output =>  
> *What is your name?*  
> *Mikko*  
> *What is your birth year?*  
> *1989*  
> *Your username is Mikko89!*
>
> *What is your name?*  
> *Alex*  
> *What is your birth year?*  
> *1996*  
> *Your username is Alex1996!*

The solution can be found [here](Exercise_2/).

## Exercise 3

> Make a *lottery generator* that returns an *array* with *7* random numbers between *1* and *39* and prints them all to the console. *If you can: Sort them using Array::sort and also randomize duplicates again*.
>
> Example output =>  
> *Your lottery numbers are: 2, 5, 8, 23, 30, 32, 39*

The solution can be found [here](Exercise_3/).

## Exercise 4 (Bonus, TODO later on..)

> Create a shopping list program that takes input. It should put your input as a *string* to a *vector* and print the *vector*. If you write something that already exists in the *vector* it should delete the item from the *vector*.
>
> Example output =>  
> *Milk*  
> *Milk*  
> *Juice*  
> *Milk, Juice*  
> *Eggs*  
> *Milk, Juice, Eggs*  
> *Milk*  
> *Juice, Eggs*  
> *Cheese*  
> *Juice, Eggs, Cheese*  
> *Cheese*  
> *Juice, Eggs*

## Exercise 5 (Bonus, TODO later on..)

> Take the input and flip the *string*.
>
> Example output =>  
> *Write your sentence:*  
> *Test*
> *tseT*
>
> *Write your sentence:*  
> *RaceCar*  
> *raCecaR*

## Exercise 6 (Bonus, TODO later on..)

> Find the longest repeating pattern in an input string.
>
> Example output =>  
> *Write your sentence:*  
> *nanaanaana*  
> *naa*
>
> *Write your sentence:*  
> *It is the greatest to be great*  
> *great*
>
> *Write your sentence:*  
> *aaaaaa*  
> *aaa*
