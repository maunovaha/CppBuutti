# Lecture 5

> This lecture discusses about namespaces and splitting your project to multiple files.

## Exercise 1

> Build a program with *2* structures with the same name *Bat*. The other one is a *baseball bat* and the other one is a *animal bat*. Use namespaces to separate these two structs.
>
> Both of the structs should have a function *void greet();* which prints different thing to console.
>
> Create headers and source files for both of these and use them in your main function. 

The solution can be found [here](Exercise_1/).

**Output**

```
Animal bat says *Skreeeek*
Baseball bat says *SMASH*
```

## Exercise 2 

> ... Smallerlarger game ...

## Exercise 3

> ... Poker game ...
